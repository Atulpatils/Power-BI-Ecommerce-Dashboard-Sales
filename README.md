ðŸ“šHere are the tasks that I performed:

â–¶I transformed the data using Power Query.

â–¶I used different types of customized visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, stacked bar charts, area charts, and slicers.

â–¶I used DAX queries to calculate the average order value (AOV).

â–¶I added slicers to allow users to view quarterly and state-wise data in one go.

â–¶I performed the ETL operations.
